present on Storage server in Stratos DC. The team want to setup a hook on this repository, please find below more details:


- Merge the feature branch into the master branch, but before pushing your changes complete below point.
<br><br> - Create a post-update hook in this git repository so that whenever any changes are pushed to the master branch, 
it creates a release tag with name release-2023-06-15, where 2023-06-15 is supposed to be the current date. 
For example if today is 20th June, 2023 then the release tag must be release-2023-06-20`. 
Make sure you test the hook at least once and create a release tag for today's release.
